    <p>Provides the classes necessary to create INDI Servers and a basic but functional Server.</p>
    
    <p>Usually a INDI Server inherits from <code>INDIServer</code> and implements its abstract methods. In those methods additional filtering can be done to avoid some messages arriving to some Devices or Clients. Thus, it is possible to create filering and security mechanisms.</p>
    
    <p>Please check <code>laazotea.indi.server.INDIBasicServer</code> for a functional example of an INDI Server.</p>
    
    <p>To launch the basic Server just:</p>
    
    <p><code>&gt; java -jar JavaINDIServer.jar [port]</code></p>
