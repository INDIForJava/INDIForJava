INDI Client

 This module is an abstract module for clients unsing the indi system. It is a event driven programming interface to access a remore (or local)
INDI server. It is the starting point for you if you need a programmic interface and no gui, or if you want to write your own gui. If 
you need a library that also creates a gui, please refer to the modules {{{../i4j-client-ui}Client for java Swing}} and {{{../i4j-client-fx}Client for javafx}}.
There is also an andoid library but it is out dated and not state of the art.
