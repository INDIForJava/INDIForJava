Nexstar GT

 This is a driver for the (very old) Nexstar GT telescope goto system. This driver will use NO hand controller! So the seral device should be connected directly to the mount, be carfull because it uses TTL levels.
When using this driver your handcontroller is not in use! the alignement is done with the build in math module compatible with the syncing of kstars.
