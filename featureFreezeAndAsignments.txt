This file contain a list of ideas that will be implemented for the next releases of I4J.

Additonally we can annotate if any of the feautures is actually being implemented by any of the developers.


For the next release:

- Base directory stuff ( ~/.i4j/ )   -> Zerjillo
- Element iterators in properties (and properties in drivers? and drivers in connections?)
- Avoid of api exposures (returned some ArrayList<> when List<> would be better)
- Generics in INDIProperty to help INDISwitchProperty only having INDISwitchElement as elements. Check for other types of Properties. Much less castings would be needed.
- Check the expception mehanism. Some exception may become a runtime exception to avoid try {}catch block in the drivers which make the code quite ugly. Do not directly make INDIException as a runtime one. Maybe a subclass.
- Package renaming: laazotea.blabla -> org.indilib.i4j.xxx
- Finishing refactorings for CCD and Telescope -> ritchie
- getting maven-release to work with central -> ritchie
- moving every abstract driver to it's own module. -> ritchie
-

For future releases:
